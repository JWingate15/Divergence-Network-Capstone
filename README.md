### Divergence-Network-Capstone
*Creating a small business network in GNS3*

**Project Summary** 


During the collaborative Networking Tools and Technologies (NTT) Network+ capstone project at Divergence Academy's Cybersecurity Professional Penetration Tester boot camp, I constructed a small business environment while serving as a member of a simulated managed service provider (MSP). The small business environment comprised of a secure network, an internal Windows Domain, an internal Microsoft IIS web server, an internal Windows 10 workstation, a public web server, a public FTP server, a DMZ network, a Guest network, and a LAN network. This project encompassed five distinct stages (referred to as stages 0-5), with each stage building upon the network topology established in the preceding stages. All virtual machines were accessed and added utilizing Graphical Network Simulator-3 (GNS-3). 

A description and visual representation of each stage can be found in their respective subfolders (i.e., Stage 1 overview & topology).
