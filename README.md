### Divergence-Network-Capstone
*Creating a small business network in GNS3*

**Project Summary** 


As a team member of the collaborative Network+ capstone project, "Networking Tools and Technologies (NTT)," at Divergence Academy's Cybersecurity Professional Penetration Tester 10-week immersive boot camp, I constructed a small business environment while serving as a member of a simulated managed service provider (MSP). The small business environment that I created comprised a secure network, an internal Windows Domain, an internal Microsoft IIS web server, an internal Windows 10 workstation, a public web server, a public FTP server, a DMZ network, a Guest network, and a LAN network. This project encompassed six distinct stages (referred to as stages 0-6), with each stage building upon the network topology established in the preceding stages.
