### Divergence-Network-Capstone
Creating a small business network in GNS3
<header> **Project Summary** </header>
As part of a collaborative capstone project for the Network + block of instruction for Divergence Academy's Cybersecurity Professional Penetration Tester 10-week immersive bootcamp, I built a small business environment as a member of a simulated managed service provider (MSP). The small business environment that I built included a secure network, an internal Windows Domain, an internal Microsoft IIS webserver, an internal Windows 10 workstation, a public webserver, a public FTP server, a DMZ network, a Guest network, and a LAN network.
